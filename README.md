# Blackchain-for-Humanoid-Robotics
Implementing a blockchain system for real-time humanoid robot deployment involves integrating blockchain with the humanoid system's communication and decision-making processes. The purpose of this blockchain integration could be for several reasons, such as ensuring the security of transactions, managing data integrity, controlling access, tracking actions, or even deploying AI models.

Below is a high-level Python implementation outline for integrating blockchain with humanoid robot deployment, focusing on smart contracts and data tracking in a blockchain. This could be useful for validating the state of the robot, tracking decisions, and logging key interactions or commands.

We will use Ethereum as an example blockchain, using web3.py for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, and Solidity for creating smart contracts.
Prerequisites:

    Install the required libraries:

    pip install web3

    Set up an Ethereum test network (like Ganache or Rinkeby).

Step 1: Set up a basic Smart Contract in Solidity

This contract will handle transactions related to the humanoid robot deployment. It will store information about robot actions, commands, and interactions in a decentralized way.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HumanoidDeployment {

    struct RobotAction {
        uint256 timestamp;
        string action;
        string status;
    }

    mapping(address => RobotAction[]) public actions;
    
    // Record robot action (e.g., deployment or status change)
    function recordAction(string memory action, string memory status) public {
        RobotAction memory newAction = RobotAction({
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            action: action,
            status: status
        });
        actions[msg.sender].push(newAction);
    }
    
    // Get robot actions for a specific address (robot)
    function getActions(address robot) public view returns (RobotAction[] memory) {
        return actions[robot];
    }
}

This contract allows recording and fetching the actions performed by the humanoid robot, such as deployments, movements, or status changes. The recordAction function will be called whenever a robot takes an action, storing this information on the blockchain.
Step 2: Python Web3 Interaction for Real-Time Deployment

Now, let's write the Python code to interact with the blockchain. We'll use web3.py to connect to the blockchain and call the smart contract functions.

from web3 import Web3
import json

# Connect to a local or remote Ethereum node (replace with your provider)
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545'))  # Local Ganache instance

# Check if connected to the blockchain
if w3.isConnected():
    print("Connected to the blockchain!")
else:
    print("Failed to connect.")

# Set up your wallet address and private key
account_address = '0xYourAddress'  # Replace with your wallet address
private_key = '0xYourPrivateKey'   # Replace with your private key

# Define the contract ABI and address (replace with actual contract details)
contract_address = '0xYourContractAddress'  # Replace with the deployed contract address

# Sample ABI, typically you can get this from Remix or after deploying the contract
contract_abi = json.loads("""
[{
    "inputs": [{"internalType": "string", "name": "action", "type": "string"},
               {"internalType": "string", "name": "status", "type": "string"}],
    "name": "recordAction",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
}]
""")

# Instantiate the contract
contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

# Example function to record humanoid robot action
def record_robot_action(action: str, status: str):
    nonce = w3.eth.getTransactionCount(account_address)
    
    # Build the transaction
    transaction = contract.functions.recordAction(action, status).buildTransaction({
        'chainId': 1,  # Mainnet ID, use 3 for Ropsten or your test network
        'gas': 2000000,
        'gasPrice': w3.toWei('20', 'gwei'),
        'nonce': nonce,
    })
    
    # Sign the transaction
    signed_txn = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(transaction, private_key)

    # Send the transaction
    txn_hash = w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
    print(f'Transaction hash: {w3.toHex(txn_hash)}')

# Record an action like "robot deployed" with status "success"
record_robot_action("Deployment", "Success")

# Wait for a confirmation (optional, depends on your use case)
def wait_for_confirmation(txn_hash):
    txn_receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(txn_hash)
    print("Transaction confirmed:", txn_receipt)

# Call function to record action
txn_hash = record_robot_action("Initialize Robot", "Active")
wait_for_confirmation(txn_hash)

Explanation:

    Web3 Setup: Connects to an Ethereum node, whether local (like Ganache) or remote (like Infura).
    Smart Contract ABI: Contains information about the contract's functions and parameters, which is used to interact with the contract.
    record_robot_action: This Python function builds and sends a transaction to record the action of the humanoid robot (e.g., deploying or activating).
    Signing and Sending Transactions: The private key is used to sign the transaction before sending it to the blockchain.

Step 3: Handling Real-Time Data for Deployment

For real-time deployments, the Python backend could monitor sensor data or commands from the robot, and then record each significant action (e.g., deployment start, successful task completion) on the blockchain for future tracking, auditing, and security purposes.
Step 4: Integrating Blockchain with Humanoid Robot (IoT Integration)

To integrate this with a real humanoid robot, you would typically have an API or middleware layer that takes input from the robot's sensor systems, interprets commands or status, and then calls the appropriate blockchain functions (using record_robot_action).

This can also be used for:

    Tracking commands sent to the robot.
    Storing logs or audit trails.
    Verifying that the robot executed certain tasks successfully.

You may want to set up the humanoid robot to have access to blockchain interaction through IoT protocols (like MQTT or HTTP requests) to send data to the Python server.
Conclusion

This is a simplified implementation to demonstrate how blockchain could be integrated with humanoid robot deployments using Ethereum and Python. Depending on your use case, you could expand the smart contract to include more features (like tracking multiple robots, verifying tasks, or handling robot ownership).
